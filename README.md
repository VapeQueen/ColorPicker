### 💡 ideas

 - [nypsi](https://github.com/tekoh/nypsi) $color command will have a link pointing to the same color on this website
 - random colour on every refresh ✅
 - hex color code is easily copiable with a button / always in url bar ✅
 - history page to show previous colors (saves via cookie 🍪)
